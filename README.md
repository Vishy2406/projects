# Glucose Spike Prediction from Wearable Data

This project simulates wearable health data (steps, heart rate, sleep hours, and carbohydrate intake) and builds a logistic regression model to predict glucose spikes.

## Features
- Simulated wearable-style data
- Logistic regression model with scikit-learn
- Risk visualization with matplotlib
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Importance
Glucose prediction is important in managing diabetes and building smarter wearables. This demo shows how to use simple ML to predict metabolic events.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Google Colab

## Files
- `glucose_prediction.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook
- `README.md`: Project description

## Future Work
- Use real-world wearable datasets
- Add dashboard (Streamlit or Flask)
- Integrate real-time alert system
